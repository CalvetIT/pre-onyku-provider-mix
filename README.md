# pre Onyku™ provider mix

Open Knowledge shared by Calvet IT until Onyku™ standards are defined.

Onyku™ is an open-source project with the ambition of creating a collaborative IT design software. At its core, Onyku™ relies on and contributes to Open Knowledge principles, making them an integral part of its DNA.
The product is in its very early stages, with only a basic proof of concept for the knowledge-sharing module, which is not production-ready.

This repository is a way for Calvet IT to share knowledge according to Open Knowledge principles until Onyku™ standards are defined therefore the "pre" in the name.
It will also serve as a foundation for defining future standards.
